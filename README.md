# Tornado.gov - Protocol improvement proposal
- User submits hash of nullifier alongside KYC
- hash of nullifier is included in Merkle Tree on-chain
- nullifier can be used to vote anonymously
- nullifier hash is created using a random seed that will never be revealed and the nullifier itself
- nullifiers that have been used are stored in the contract

It is not necessary to store the entire root history, since we can use our merkle proof for our nullifier hash to prove the inclusion for one merkle root and prove that it leads up to the current merkle root. This is an optimization that is done in Tornadocash.

# Acropolis - a ZKVM enabled voting mechanism

![Demo with TUI and Ethereum Audit](https://github.com/cspr-rad/acropolis/blob/main/resources/demo-video.gif)

## Authorized Anonymous Voting

Acropolis enables anonymous voting through `Signatures` over `Public Keys`. The cryptographic identity of each user is treated as a secret input and never revealed to the public. Only the `Signature` issued by an authority for a "KYC-ed" user, alongside with the corresponding `Public Key` (one `Public Key` per election that is owned by the authority) are published for each election. An election is defined as a cycle with a fixed set of options to choose from and authorized identities (=`Signatures` over `Public Keys`).

The primary identifier of an election is an authorized `Public Key`, that is unique for each election. The payload that is signed by the authority is the `Public Key` of the authorized voter concatenated with the election `Public Key` (which acts as salt). 

_Each authorized user may only vote once per election._

An eligible user may submit a vote for an election by generating a zero-knowledge proof where the public inputs are:

 - The authority's `Public Key` associated with the election
 - The salted signature of the user's public key produced by the authority
 - The user's vote selection (a string)

The private inputs to the zero-knowledge proof are:

 - The user's `Public Key`
 - A signature of the user's vote selection

## How It Works Exactly

We utilize a risc0 guest program (circuit) to construct the proof.

The risc0 guest program performs the following:

 1. Validates, using the _authority's_ `Public Key`, the signature of the user's public key concatenated with the authority's `Public Key`
 2. Validates, using the _user's_ `Public Key`, the signature of the user's vote selection

## The Client

The Client can be used to issue identities, generate keypairs and submit votes.

```bash
cargo run -p acropolis
```

```
Usage: acropolis <COMMAND>

Commands:
  vote               
  generate-key-pair  
  issue-identity     
  help               Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

The Client crate has a `groth16` feature that indicates whether to submit a proof to the api and ethereum, or just the api.
Risc0-groth16 currently only supports x86 architecture and therefore this feature may not be enabled when running unsupported architecture.

## Auditing the API

Our API serves all `Elections` and their `Votes`. An external entity can utilize the functionality exposed by our `audit-utils` crate to verify all ZKPs (=votes) independently.
The client exposes an `audit` endpoint that can be used to verify a set of votes. We scrape the votes the Smart Contract and dump them to a file that is fully auditable. The audit will evaluate all votes, verify all Zero Knowledge Proofs, flag malicious voters and output legitimate election results.

## Simple CLI Voting

First run the API and initialize Elections alongside with Accounts:

```bash
cargo run -p api
```

Open another terminal (or split tmux) and submit a vote:

```bash
cargo run -p acropolis -- --user-id-path ./election-1/user-1 --vote "dogs_and_cats"
```

Proving will take some time, once finished the API will serve the current state of the election.
To query elections:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/fetch_elections
```

To query all votes (+ ZK proofs) of an election that have been verified by the API:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/fetch_votes/<election_hex>
```

## Additional Contributions

We hopefully improved the developer experience by submitting a PR that packages kurtosis with Nix: https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis/pull/2461
